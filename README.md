# Tabulated Recent Activity

This GitHub Action is a fork of [recent-activity](https://github.com/Readme-Workflows/recent-activity) by [Readme-Workflows](https://github.com/Readme-Workflows).  
It is nearly identical, with the only difference being that the recent activity data is tabulated

## To Use
First, copy the existing instructions from the forked repository

Then, in your README file, structure your recent activity like so:
```
<table align="center">
  <tbody>
  <!--RECENT_ACTIVITY:start-->
  <!--RECENT_ACTIVITY:end-->
  </tbody>
</table>
```

Lastly, use the latest version of this workflow, instead of the forked repository's workflow
